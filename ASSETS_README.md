# Brand Assets Placement

## Required Assets

To complete the branding implementation, please add the following PNG files:

### Landing Page (`nymai-landing`)
- **File**: `NymAI_full_logo.png`
- **Location**: `public/NymAI_full_logo.png`
- **Usage**: Full logo displayed in the header
- **Reference**: `/NymAI_full_logo.png`

### Extension (`nymai-extension`)
- **File**: `NymAI_icon.png`
- **Location**: `assets/NymAI_icon.png` (root level `assets/` folder)
- **Usage**: Compact "N" icon displayed in popup header
- **Reference**: `/NymAI_icon.png`

## Notes
- The landing page uses Vite, so assets in `public/` are served from the root path
- The extension uses Plasmo, which serves assets from the root `assets/` folder
- Both code files have been updated to reference these assets
- Once the PNG files are added to the specified locations, the branding will be complete
