# NymAI Landing Page - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values (optional)
# These values have defaults in the code, so the app will work without setting them

# Supabase Configuration
# SECURITY NOTE: These values are SAFE TO BE PUBLIC
# - Supabase anon keys are designed to be public (protected by Row Level Security)
# - Supabase URL is a public endpoint
# Using environment variables allows for easier configuration across environments

# Note: These values are already hardcoded as defaults in the application
# Setting them as environment variables is optional but recommended for:
# - Different environments (dev/staging/prod)
# - Easier updates without code changes
# - Better configuration management

# To use these in Vercel:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project settings
# 2. Navigate to Environment Variables
# 3. Add each variable with the VITE_ prefix
# 4. Deploy your application
